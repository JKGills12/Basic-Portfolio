    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
            <p>Hello World! My name is Jennie Khann and I am a born and raised Washingtonian. Even though I was born and raised here, I wouldn't say that I know everything about Washington. There's just so much about this state and the world itself that I haven't learned or experienced. But, for living here the majority of my life, I would say Washington is a beautiful state for nature lovers. We are blessed to have all four seasons, and so we get to also have a variety of outdoor activities to do! Enjoy snow activities? We have mountains to go skiing/snowboarding/snow-shoeing! Love walking or hiking? There's no lack of parks or hiking trails in the area with a beautiful scenery to absorb. Big fan of the water in the summer? We have some beaches and lakes to swim in or paddleboard on. Although, it's not usually the warmest for swimming in if your not trying to get cool from a hot summer's day. So really, I have pretty much the best of each season to enjoy here in the PNW. </p>
